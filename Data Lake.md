# Data Lake

A Data Lake is a centralized repository that allows you to **store**, **process**, and **analyze** vast amounts of 
**structured**, **semi-structured**, and **unstructured** data at any scale. 

Unlike traditional databases, which require data to be structured before storage, a data lake allows raw data to be 
stored as-is and later transformed based on analytical needs.
