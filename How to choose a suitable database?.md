# How to choose a suitable database?

| **Use Case**                          | **Recommended Database**                        | **Reasoning** |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **Relational data with strong consistency <br> (e.g., Banking, ERP, CRM)** | PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server | ACID compliance, strong consistency, structured data |
| **High scalability & distributed data <br>(e.g., Social Media, E-commerce analytics)** | Cassandra, DynamoDB, Google Bigtable | NoSQL, horizontal scalability, high availability |
| **Fast reads, caching <br>(e.g., Session storage, Leaderboards, Caching layer)** | Redis, Memcached | In-memory, low-latency, high-performance |
| **Full-text search <br>(e.g., Search engines, Log analysis)** | Elasticsearch, OpenSearch | Optimized for text search, indexing, and fast retrieval |
| **Time-series data <br>(e.g., IoT sensors, Monitoring, Financial data analytics)** | InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, Prometheus | Optimized for time-based queries, efficient storage |
| **Graph-based relationships <br>(e.g., Social networks, Recommendation engines, Fraud detection)** | Neo4j, ArangoDB, Amazon Neptune | Graph database, optimized for relationships and traversals |
| **Document storage <br>(e.g., Content management, Product catalogs, User profiles)** | MongoDB, CouchDB, Firebase Firestore | NoSQL document model, flexible schema |
| **Event streaming and real-time processing <br>(e.g., Logs, Clickstream analytics, Event-driven systems)** | Apache Kafka, Pulsar, Amazon Kinesis | Distributed streaming, real-time processing |
| **Data warehousing & analytics <br>(e.g., Business Intelligence, Big Data processing)** | Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift | Optimized for OLAP, parallel query processing |
| **Hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) <br>(e.g., Mixed workloads, real-time analytics on live data)** | TiDB, SingleStore, CockroachDB | Combines OLTP and OLAP capabilities |
| **Decentralized applications <br>(e.g., Blockchain, Distributed ledger systems)** | Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, IPFS (for file storage) | Distributed, tamper-proof, blockchain-based |
